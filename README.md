# Data structures and algorithms
I am aiming to contain implementations for several data structures and algorithms in this repository.
It will hopefully grow over time.

## Included data structure implementations
- Fixed size array
- Singly linked list
- Dynamic array
- Stack
- Queue
- Doubly linked list
- Hash table

## Included algorithm implementations
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Newton's square root
- Bubble sort
- Floyd's tortoise and hare
