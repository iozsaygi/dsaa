# Data structures and algorithms

I am aiming to contain implementations for several data structures and algorithms in this repository.
It will hopefully grow over time.

## Included data structure implementations

- Fixed size array
- Singly linked list
- Dynamic array
- Stack
- Queue
- Doubly linked list
- Hash table with linear probing
- Binary tree
- Min-heap
- Circular singly linked list

## Included algorithm implementations

- Linear search
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Newton's square root
- Bubble sort
- Floyd's tortoise and hare
- Counting sort
- Linear congruential generator
- Sleep sort (Windows API)
- Quick sort
- Breadth first search
